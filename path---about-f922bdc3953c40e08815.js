By day I sculpt online magic at Bynder. And by night I like to wander around in the ever evolving landscapes of front-end development.</p>\n<p>I’ve been designing for the last 8 years and got into developing about 6 years ago. I tend to spend the most of my time working with CSS, HTML and Javascript and feel quite comfortable using it.</p>\n<p>This website is like a digital playground to me. A place where I can explore new things and share them in a way I wished they where explained to me. I learn from the community and love to share what I have learned back.</p>\n<p>When I’m not building websites I love spending time with my girlfriend <a href="http://samanthavolk.nl" target="_blank">Samantha</a>, family and friends. Listening to some quality music, writing, fitness or running. Oohw and when I feel inspired and got some spare time left also got some aspirations in making music myself.</p>\n<p>More questions about me or want to chat?
