I’m curious about what kind of tools/services they’re using to make their development life even more pleasant. I think it’s a good thing too keep an eye on other developers and be open minded about trying new tools from time to time. So I thought I’d also put together a post about my setup and the tools I use, and maybe, just maybe, inspire someone else.</p>\n<h2>Hardware</h2>\n<h3>15” MacBook Pro</h3>\n<p>Currently I’m running a mid 2012 15” Macbook Pro. I really enjoy using it I’ve installed a 256gb SSD and removed my Disk Driver in favour of my old 750gb harddrive. Maybe it’s not the newest Mac anymore but it’s still blazing fast.</p>\n<p>Although I’m not planning for a new Macbook anytime soon my next machine will be more portable. At my daily job I’m using a 13” Retina Macbook Pro and I absolutely love it’s portability.</p>\n<h3>27” Thunderbolt Display</h3>\n<p>Actually I own two great displays, a <a href="https://www.dell.com/ae/business/p/dell-u2711/pd" title="Dell UltraSharp U2711">Dell UltraSharp U2711</a> and a <a href="https://www.apple.com/displays/" title="Apple Thunderbolt Display">27” Apple Thunderbolt Display</a>. To be honest I like the U2711 better because of the matte screen is easier on my eyes. But the aesthetics of the Thunderbolt Display won it in the end for me plus I like the fact it instantly “charges” my Macbook.</p>\n<h3>Apple Wireless Keyboard &#x26; Magic Mouse</h3>\n<p>Just as with the Thunderbolt Display I only like the aesthetics of the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/mac/mac-accessories" title="Apple Shop Accessories">keyboard and mouse</a>. They look great on my desk. But to be honest they’re horrible to work with. I’m thinking about replacing my keyboard with a <a href="https://www.elitekeyboards.com/products.php?sub=pfu_keyboards,hhkbpro2&#x26;pid=pdkb400b" title="Happy Hacking Professional 2">Happy Hacking Professional 2</a> a mechanical keyboard. I’ve just not convinced my self yet I need it enough to justify the price.</p>\n<h3>Herman Miller Mirra</h3>\n<p>Maybe just as, or even more important than a good Macbook. A bit <a href="https://store.hermanmiller.com/Products/Mirra-Chair" title="Herman Miller Mira">expensive</a> but worth every dime and it looks nice right?</p>\n<h3>RainDesign mStand</h3>\n<p>Just a <a href="https://www.raindesigninc.com/mstand.html" title="Rain Design mStand">stand</a>, I like to have my Macbook lifted of the desk so I don’t have to look down that much when I’ve got my Macbook hooked to my external display.</p>\n<h3>Shure SE 215 &#x26; Sony MDR-1Am</h3>\n<p>I love to get in the “zone” when I’m programming. I good pair of headphones is essential for me. Most of the time I’m using my <a href="https://www.shure.com/americas/products/earphones/se-earphones/se215-sound-isolating-earphones" title="Shure SE 215">Shure’s</a> in favour of my <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/headband-headphones/mdr-1a" title="Sony MDR-1A">Sony headphones</a> because they feel lighter and overall better sound quality.</p>\n<h2>Software</h2>\n<h3>Sublime Text</h3>\n<p>For writing code I use <a href="https://www.sublimetext.com/3" title="Sublime Text">Sublime Text</a>. During the nighttime I’m fiddling aground with <a href="https://www.vim.org/" title="Vim">Vim</a> but I’m not yet productive enough too say farewell to Sublime Text. So during my daily job my weapon of choice is Sublime Text because it’s a very minimal, extensible and blazingly fast.</p>\n<h3>iTerm2</h3>\n<p>I find myself working more and more with the command-line-interface. I’m actually getting quite comfortable with it. The reason I started using <a href="https://www.iterm2.com/" title="iTem2">iTerm 2</a> is because of it’s flexibility and configurability. I think it’s quite funny when I think back to a few years ago. At that time I wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole. Right now I actually prefer the command-line-interface over an app with a GUI.</p>\n<h3>Git</h3>\n<p>God how could I have ever written code without <a href="https://git-scm.com/" title="Git">git?!</a> I absolutely love working with version control and my weapon of choice is git. Not working with version control? Seriously you should consider start using it.</p>\n<h3>Sketch</h3>\n<p>Schooled for using the Adobe suit I’m a long time user of <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/" title="Sketch">Sketch</a>. I love it’s simplicity and the fact that I don’t have to pay a monthly fee for using it. Although it has it fair amount of bugs I think it’s a great tool.</p>\n<h3>Ulysses</h3>\n<p><a href="https://www.ulyssesapp.com/" title="Ulysses">Ulysses</a> is my go to tool for al my writing app. For blogposts or documentation. I love the clean interface it makes me feel productive and focussed. Also it’s build in library and live preview are really awesome.</p>\n<h3>Alfred</h3>\n<p>I’m a real productivity freak and I love al the great workflows available for <a href="https://www.alfredapp.com/" title="Alfred">Alfred</a>. It’s Spotlight on steroids. I also like the fact that you can easily write your own workflows. I try to make it a habit to when I’m doing an repetitive task that start to annoy me to write an workflow for it.</p>\n<h3>Reeder 3</h3>\n<p><a href="https://reederapp.com/mac/" title="Reeder 3">Reeder</a> is my news reader of choice I’m using Feedly as service for pulling in al the news. Every morning I check my feed to stay update date with all the subjects I find interesting.</p>\n<h2>Services</h2>\n<h3>GitHub</h3>\n<p>To keep everything safe and in sync I use <a href="https://github.com/" title="GitHub">GitHub</a>. I use GitHub for my private repositories but also for some open-source work. It’s a great service for my Git workflow but also to keep an eye on interesting projects.</p>\n<h3>Spotify</h3>\n<p>Music is perhaps my second most thing I’m passionate about next to programming. <a href="https://www.spotify.com" title="Spotify">Spotify</a> is such a great service that I’m happy to pay €10 a month for. It’s a service I use at least 8 hours a day. Music keeps me focussed and creative, without music I would be a whole lot less happy.</p>\n<h2>To conclude</h2>\n<p>So that’s basically it. I’m sure I missed some things but I guess they’re not as vital to my workflow as the others. Have a question or do you have an app/service I should definitely check out?
